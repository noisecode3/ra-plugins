## START

[1.0.0] sep 12 2021
# NewPlugin Moog
Algorithms for Mood https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP.
# Subjective Moog
Changed thermal value from 25 to 26.
# Added Moog
Smoothing parameters to avoid clicks.

[1.0.0] sep 12 2021
# NewPlugin Hexed
Modified filter https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed.
# Subjective Hexed
Changed one part of the 1:st stage frequency calculation done in cascade with the cutoff frequency. Parameter changes to the cutoff frequency makes very small changes to this part, and are now scaled at much lower frequency. I think of this as a component of Impulse Response and filter design.
# Subjective Hexed
Changed the dynamics of the resonance and filter, the balance of parameters volume.
# Added Hexed
Smoothing parameters to avoid clicks.
