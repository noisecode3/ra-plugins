# Robot Audio Plugins
This is a work in progress! I like noisy and heavy music mostly and are interested in those sounds.

## Moog filter
This is a low-pass filter with resonance that boost cut-off frequency. It's the original ladder.

# Prepare
You need to have mesa headers and basic build tools from you're distribution. make install will install in you home folder, in the future I will make root installation.

installation:
=============

    git clone https://github.com/noisecode3/ra-plugins
    cd ra-plugins
    git submodule update --init
    make
    make install
