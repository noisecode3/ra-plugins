# Robot Audio Plugins

I'm right now porting some filters here to linux dpf-plugins from synths/dsp-libs or other rt plugins/code that have license that allow me to do so. I also have some of my own "home brewed/half made" plugins that I'm gonna push here when they are whole and finished with no wild experimental parts and dirty code left in them.
